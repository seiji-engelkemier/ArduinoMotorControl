# ArduinoMotorControl

These are the Arduino files I'm using to work on a summer research project.
As by the name of the repository, the files pertain to controlling a stepper motor using an Arduino Mega board.

The main files are ...

SimulMultiButton which currently controls three motors (Nema 17) simultaneously through a TB6560 motor driver. I started working on adding a master control pair of buttons to move all three motors together but did not finish it.

Stepmotor which is being used to control a Nema23 motor through a A4988 driver.
